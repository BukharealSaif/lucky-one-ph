      <h1>How react works?</h1>
      <h2>
        Answer: React.js is a Javascript library that is used for building user
        interphases or UI. React works in the way of decorative code. In a web
        browser, React implements a virtual DOM which is basically a DOM tree
        representation in JavaScript. So when it needs to read or write or
        access to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of that DOM
        created by React. After that, the virtual DOM will try to find the most
        efficient way to update the browser's DOM.

      <h1>How UseState works?</h1>
      <h2>
        Answer: The useState() acts like a Hook that allows a user to have
        declare variables in functional components. There are two types of
        components in React, one of them is the class components which are ES6
        classes that extend from React and the other one is functional
        components. The useState hook is a special function that takes the
        initial state as an argument and returns an array of two entries.
